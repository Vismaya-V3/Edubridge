#👩🏼‍🤝‍👩🏼 Maruti Stoke Exchange using LINEAR REGRESSION :

In LR we shows, an approach for predicting a response using a single feature.Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the dependent variable(y) as accurately as possible as a function of independent variable(x).
In Maruti Stoke Exchange we take the dependent variable(y) as VWAP(Volume Weighted Average Price), and the independent variable(x) as Trades from the dataset.So we have to check the accuracy of Trades and VWAP.
